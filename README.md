# node-dtls-client

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!


[DTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram_Transport_Layer_Security) protocol implementation for Node.js written in TypeScript. 
This library provides the missing native DTLS support for Node.js client-side applications. It contains no server-side implementation.

Although great care has been taken to properly implement the required encryption and validation, 
there's no explicit protection against TLS attacks. Thus it is not advised to use it for security-critical applications. 
This libary's main goal is to allow using protocols that *require* DTLS.

## Usage

Establish a secure connection:
```
var dtls = require("node-dtls-client");

const socket = dtls
	// create a socket and initialize the secure connection
	.createSocket(options /* DtlsOptions */)
	// subscribe events
	.on("connected", () => {/* start sending data */})
	.on("error", (e /* Error */) => { })
	.on("message", (msg /* Buffer */) => { })
	.on("close", () => { })
	;
```

The DtlsOptions object looks as follows:
```
{
	type: "udp4",
	address: "ip or host",
	port: 5684,
	psk: { "psk_hint": "PSK" },
	timeout: 1000 // in ms, optional, minimum 100, default 1000
}
```

Send some data (after the `connected` event was received):
```
socket.send(data /* Buffer */, [callback]);
```

The events are defined as follows:
- `connected`: A secure connection has been established. Start sending data in the callback
- `error`: An error has happened. This usually means the handshake was not successful
- `message`: The socket received some data.
- `close`: The connection was closed successfully.



## Missing features:
- [*] alert protocol implementation (partially supported)
- [ ] cipher suites with non-PSK key exchange algorithms: dhe_dss | dhe_rsa | rsa | dh_dss | dh_rsa | dhe_psk | rsa_psk
- [ ] packet retransmission
- [ ] session renegotiation
- [ ] other compression algorithms except NULL
